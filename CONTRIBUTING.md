## Getting Started
Contributions to this repo are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see issues that are labelled `good first issue` or `documentation` to slowly get familiar with the codebase
  - If you have any questions please ask!
